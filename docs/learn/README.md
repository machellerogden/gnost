# Learn Targets

> This documentation is still a work-in-progress. Currently, there should be enough here to get you up and running, but some of the documentation for more advanced functionality has not yet been published.

The tutorials in this chapter will cover everything from basic terminology and setup, through advanced configuration and target composition. You will learn all the core usage patterns you will need to work with the framework. By the end, you should be able to write a rich targets-based command-line tool.
