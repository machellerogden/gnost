> Targets has not yet been tested on Linux or Windows. It probably works fine on Linux, but there's a good chance it does not work at all on Windows. Addressing this gap in testing is on the roadmap.

#### Please ensure you meet the following requirements before getting started:

* Node v10.3.0 or higher (v10.8.0 is recommended)
* Mac OS X
