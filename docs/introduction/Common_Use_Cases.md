# Common Use Cases

Use Targets to author tooling for:

* scheduling builds and deployments
* operating on cloud resources
* managing messages and dead-letter queues in event-based systems
* auditing source control systems at scale
* auditing dependencies in a micro-services architecture
* managing configuration and secrets

To be clear, Targets doesn't do any of the above out-of-the-box but rather it enables you to quickly and easily author tools which can.
