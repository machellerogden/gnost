# Motivation

Today's tech platform relies on dozens if not hundreds of different tools and services. AWS alone offers over 140 services. Even when an organization adopts a "Platform-as-a-Service" (PaaS), there are still many other systems which remain integral to the platform which reside outside of the PaaS. There is no singular tech platform in existenceâ€”all tech platforms are bespoke by necessity. And, bespoke platforms beget bespoke tooling. And here's where our story begins:

There is a problem with how we go about authoring developer tooling.

Historically, developers would hack together a few scripts in their free time ...

DevOps teams and Developer Platform Teams on the rise ...

Still scripting one-off solutions ... Even if using Go, Python, Node, new hotness ... too single purpose ...

All of a sudden the tooling, which is supposed to be the glue which binds the platfrom needs it's own glue.
