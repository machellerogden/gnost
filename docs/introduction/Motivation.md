# Motivation

The "developer platform" at a given tech organization today is more often than not a host of disparate solutions which have been adopted and then bound together by little more than half a dozen third-party CLIs, a few shell scripts and the moniker of "platform".

Even when an organization adopts a "Platform-as-a-Service" (PaaS), there are still many systems which remain integral to the "platform" which reside outside of the PaaS.

There are some tech organizations which get much closer to a what might be considered a true developer platform by authoring bespoke services and tooling which enable their developers to operate across the various underlying integrations more seamlessly. The rise of developer platform teams found at many organizations is a testament to the effectiveness of this approach.

But what happens when an organization finds itself with too many in-house tools? The tooling itself begins to face the same problem it originally sought to remedyâ€”it needs something to bind it all together. The tooling, in order to fulfill it's intended purpose, needs to be able to present itself as singular interface to it's users. This is not entirely a new problem and there are organizations who have built and maintain higher-order tools which unite all of the other tools, but until now there has not been a framework which is purpose-built for this specific endeavor.

This is the purpose which Targets seeks to fulfill.

Targets strives to provides a framework for turning your organization's entire developer toolbox into a Swiss Army knife. It makes authoring higher-order tools fun and easy by preferring declarative solutions and baking in everything you might need for the 80% use case.
