# Motivation

The "developer platform" at a given tech organization today is more often than not a host of disparate solutions which have been adopted and then bound together by little more than half a dozen third-party CLIs, a few shell scripts and the moniker of "platform".

Even when an organization adopts a "Platform-as-a-Service" (PaaS), there are still many systems which remain integral to the "platform" but which reside outside of the PaaS.

Many tech organizations get closer to a what might be considered a true developer platform by authoring bespoke services and tooling which allow developers to operate across the various underlying integrations more seemlessly. But what happens when an organization finds itself with too much in-house tooling? The tooling faces the same problem it sought to remedyâ€”there is nothing to bind it all together.

This is the challenge which Targets strives to address.
