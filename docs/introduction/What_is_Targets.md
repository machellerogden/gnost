# What is Targets?

Targets takes the concept of function composition and surfaces it to the
command-line. It enables you, the author of the next great CLI tool, to take
many small single-purpose functions and to safely compose them into complex but
reliable workflows using a succint declarative syntax.

Use Targets to build common tooling for your team/users and to reduce complex
workflows into reliable tasks and which are simple to operate on.
