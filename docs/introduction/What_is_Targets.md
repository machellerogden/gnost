# What is Targets?

Targets takes the concept of function composition and surfaces it to the command-line. It enables you, the author of the next great CLI tool, to take many small single-purpose functions and to safely compose them into complex but reliable workflows using a succinct declarative syntax. Beyond this, it allows for painless integration of existing tooling into it's workflows.

Use Targets to build common tooling for your team/users and to reduce complex workflows into reliable tasks and which are simple to operate on.
