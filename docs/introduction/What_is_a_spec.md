# What is a "spec"?

Targets can be written as code, or, for certain types of targets—such as shell commands or HTTP requests—targets can be declared. When declaring a target, we call this a "spec". Targets supports a few useful spec formats out-of-the-box, and supports custom loaders which enable you to implement your own spec interpreters.
